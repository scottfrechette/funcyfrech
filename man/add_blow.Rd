\arguments{
\item{tbl}{A tidy dataset with one row per feature and set}

\item{group}{Column of groups between which to compare features, such as
documents for text data}

\item{feature}{Column of features for identifying differences, such as words or
bigrams with text data}

\item{n}{Column containing feature-set counts}

\item{topic}{(Optional) topic to compare groups within}

\item{.prior}{Whether prior should be based on total frequency count (empirical),
g-prior from empirical Bayes (informed) or uninformed with set alpha (uninformed)}

\item{.alpha}{(Optional) Frequency of each feature for uninformed prior}

\item{.k_prior}{Penalty term for informed prior}

\item{.compare}{Whether to compare group-feature to entire dataset or
against all other groups}

\item{.center}{Whether to center log_odds_weighted across groups}

\item{.unweighted}{Whether to include point estimate log odds}

\item{.variance}{Whether to include variance of feature}

\item{.odds}{Whether to include odds of seeing feature within group}

\item{.prob}{Whether to include probability for feature within group}

\description{
Calculate and bind the log odds ratio, weighted by an uninformative Dirichlet
prior, of a tidy dataset to the dataset itself. The weighted log odds ratio
is added as a column. This functions supports non-standard evaluation through
the tidyeval framework.
}
\details{
The arguments \code{group}, \code{feature}, \code{n}, and \code{topic}
are passed by expression and support \link[rlang]{quasiquotation};
you can unquote strings and symbols. Grouping is preserved but ignored.

The dataset must have exactly one row per group-feature combination for
this calculation to succeed. Read Monroe, Colaresi, and Quinn (2017) for
more on the weighted log odds ratio.
